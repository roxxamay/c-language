### Code Explanation

#### Code Snippet

```c
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int l,b,h,a,v;
    printf("\nLENGTH OF THE CUBOID:");
    scanf("%i",&l);
    printf("\nBREADTH OF THE CUBOID:");
    scanf("%i",&b);
    printf("\nHEIGHT OF THE CUBOID:");
    scanf("%i",&h);

    a=2*(l*b+b*h+h*l);
    v=l*b*h;
    printf("\nHENCE THE AREA IS %i",a);
    printf("\nHENCE THE VOLUME IS %i",v);
    getch();
}
```

#### Detailed Explanation

##### 1. Include Directive

```c
#include"main.h"
```

-  **Keyword**: `#include`
-  **Concept**: Preprocessor directive
-  **Explanation**: The `#include` directive tells the preprocessor to include the contents of another file in the program. In this case, it includes the header file named `main.h`. Header files typically contain declarations of functions, macros, and other entities that are used across multiple source files.

##### 2. Function Definition

```c
int main()
```

-  **Keyword**: `int`
-  **Concept**: Return type of a function
-  **Explanation**: The `int` keyword specifies that the `main` function returns an integer value. In C, the `main` function serves as the entry point of the program. Its return value indicates whether the program executed successfully.

##### 3. Variable Declaration

```c
int l,b,h,a,v;
```

-  **Keywords**: `int`, `l`, `b`, `h`, `a`, `v`
-  **Concept**: Variable declaration
-  **Explanation**: Variables `l`, `b`, and `h` are declared to store the length, breadth, and height of a cuboid, respectively. Variables `a` and `v` are declared to store the calculated surface area and volume of the cuboid.

##### 4. Input Operation

```c
printf("\nLENGTH OF THE CUBOID:");
scanf("%i",&l);
```

-  **Keywords**: `printf`, `scanf`
-  **Concept**: Standard I/O functions
-  **Explanation**: `printf` displays a prompt asking for the length of the cuboid. `scanf` reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable `l`.

##### 5. Calculation of Surface Area and Volume

```c
a=2*(l*b+b*h+h*l);
v=l*b*h;
```

-  **Concept**: Arithmetic operations
-  **Explanation**: The surface area `a` of a cuboid is calculated using the formula `2(lw + lh + wh)`, and the volume `v` is calculated using the formula `lwh`.

##### 6. Output Operation

```c
printf("\nHENCE THE AREA IS %i",a);
printf("\nHENCE THE VOLUME IS %i",v);
```

-  **Keywords**: `printf`
-  **Concept**: Format specifier `%i`
-  **Explanation**: `printf` is used to display the calculated surface area and volume of the cuboid. The `%i` format specifier is used to print integer values.

##### 7. Waiting for User Input

```c
getch();
```

-  **Keyword**: `getch`
-  **Concept**: Non-standard I/O function
-  **Explanation**: `getch()` waits for the user to press a key before terminating the console window. It's often used in DOS-based systems to prevent the console window from closing immediately after the program finishes executing.

### Dry Run

Let's assume the user inputs `3` for length, `4` for breadth, and `5` for height.

1. `l` is set to `3`.
2. `b` is set to `4`.
3. `h` is set to `5`.
4. The surface area `a` is calculated as `2*(3*4 + 4*5 + 5*3)` which equals `94`.
5. The volume `v` is calculated as `3*4*5` which equals `60`.
6. The program prints "HENCE THE AREA IS 94" and "HENCE THE VOLUME IS 60".
7. The program waits for the user to press a key due to `getch()`.

### Additional Context

This code demonstrates basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and the use of pointers in C. Understanding these concepts is crucial for beginners learning C programming.
