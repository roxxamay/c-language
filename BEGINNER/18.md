Ah, a spell of coordinates, a charm that dances with points, revealing the secrets of distance with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of space with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Coordinates

```c
/*********************************************************************
write program to find the distance between two coordinate points?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int x,y,a,b;
    float z;
    printf("HERE (X,Y) ARE THE COORDINATES OF THE 1ST POINT AND (A,B) ARE THE COORDINATES OF THE SECOND POINT");
    printf("\nINPUT THE COORDINATES OF THE 1ST POINT IN FORM OF (X,Y):  ");
    scanf("%i,%i",&x,&y);
    printf("\nINPUT THE COORDINATES OF THE SECOND POINT IN FORM OF (A,B):  ");
    scanf("%i,%i",&a,&b);
    
    //calculation
    z=sqrt(pow(a-x,2)+pow(b-y,2));

    printf("\nHENCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS IS:  %f",z);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
   - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

- **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

- **`int x,y,a,b; float z;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `x`, `y` for the first point, `a`, `b` for the second point, and `z` for distance, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

- **`printf("HERE (X,Y) ARE THE COORDINATES OF THE 1ST POINT AND (A,B) ARE THE COORDINATES OF THE SECOND POINT");** A call to the user, a plea for the first point's coordinates. 📢
- **`scanf("%i,%i",&x,&y);** The first response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
- **`printf("\nINPUT THE COORDINATES OF THE SECOND POINT IN FORM OF (A,B):  ");** Another call, another plea, this time for the second point. 📢
- **`scanf("%i,%i",&a,&b);** The second response, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
- **`z=sqrt(pow(a-x,2)+pow(b-y,2));** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, calculating the distance. 🧮
- **`printf("\nHENCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS IS:  %f",z);** The revelation, the distance unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
- **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Coordinate Charm

In the realm of geometry, where points stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks of the user, two sets of coordinates, each entered with a plea. With responses, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formula `z=sqrt(pow(a-x,2)+pow(b-y,2)` for distance, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A span that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS IS:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just a number, but a bridge between worlds. 🎭
