Ah, a spell of spheres, a charm that dances with radii, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and volume with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of the Sphere

```c
/*********************************************************************
find the area and volume of sphere?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    float r,a,v,m;
    printf("\nENTER THE DESIRED LENGTH OF RADIUS:");
    scanf("%f",&r);
    v=4*3.14*r*r*r/3;
    a=4*3.14*r*r;
    printf("\nHENCE AREA=%f",a);
    printf("\n HENCE VOLUME=%f",v);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`float r,a,v,m;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `r` for radius, `a` for area, and `v` for volume, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nENTER THE DESIRED LENGTH OF RADIUS:")**: A call to the user, a plea for the sphere's radius. 📢
-   **`scanf("%f",&r);** The response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`v=4*3.14*r*r*r/3;** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, turning a radius into volume. 🧮
-   **`a=4*3.14*r\*r;** The surface, a dance of multiplication, encircling the sphere. 📏
-   **`printf("\nHENCE AREA=%f",a);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\n HENCE VOLUME=%f",v);** The final act, the volume revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Sphere Charm

In the realm of shapes, where spheres stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks but one thing of the user - the radius. With a response, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `v=4*3.14*r*r*r/3` for volume and `a=4*3.14*r*r` for area, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a space that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE AREA=... HENCE VOLUME=..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
