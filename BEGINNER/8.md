Ah, a spell of dimensions, a charm that dances with edges, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and volume with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Dimensions

```c
/*********************************************************************
find the area and volume of cuboid?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int l,b,h,a,v;
    printf("\nLENGTH OF THE CUBOID:");
    scanf("%i",&l);
    printf("\nBREADTH OF THE CUBOID:");
    scanf("%i",&b);
    printf("\nHEIGHT OF THE CUBOID:");
    scanf("%i",&h);

    a=2*(l*b+b*h+h*l);
    v=l*b*h;
    printf("\nHENCE THE AREA IS %i",a);
    printf("\nHENCE THE VOLUME IS %i",v);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`int l,b,h,a,v;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `l` for length, `b` for breadth, `h` for height, `a` for area, and `v` for volume, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nLENGTH OF THE CUBOID:")**: A call to the user, a plea for the cuboid's length. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&l);** The first response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nBREADTH OF THE CUBOID:")**: Another call, another plea, this time for breadth. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&b);** The second response, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nHEIGHT OF THE CUBOID:")**: A third call, a deeper mystery. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&h);** The third response, the final ingredient, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`a=2*(l*b+b*h+h*l);** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, turning dimensions into area. 🧮
-   **`v=l*b*h;** The volume, a dance of multiplication, encircling the cuboid. 📏
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE AREA IS %i",a);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE VOLUME IS %i",v);** The final act, the volume revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Dimensional Charm

In the realm of shapes, where cuboids stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks of the user, three dimensions, each entered with a plea. With responses, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `a=2*(l*b+b*h+h*l)` for area and `v=l*b*h` for volume, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a space that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE THE AREA IS... HENCE THE VOLUME IS..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
