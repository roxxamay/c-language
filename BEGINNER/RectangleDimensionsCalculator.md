/*Problem Statement:
Title: Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator
 
Difficulty Level: Easy
 
Problem:
 
Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a function named calculateAreaAndPerimeter that takes two parameters, length and breadth, and returns a tuple containing the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated as length * breadth, and the perimeter is calculated as 2 * (length + breadth).
 
If either the length or breadth is less than 1, the function should return (0, 0), indicating that the dimensions are invalid.
 
Function Signature:
 
#include <stdio.h>
 
typedef struct {
     int area;
     int perimeter;
} RectangleDimensions;
 
RectangleDimensions calculateAreaAndPerimeter(int length, int breadth);
Example Usage:
 
int main() {
    RectangleDimensions dims = calculateAreaAndPerimeter(5, 3);
    printf("Area: %d\nPerimeter: %d\n", dims.area, dims.perimeter);
    return 0;
}
Constraints:
 
Both length and breadth are integers within the range [1, 10^5].
The function must not use any external libraries or global variables.
Objective: Write a function that accurately calculates and returns the area and perimeter of a rectangle according to the specifications above. Ensure your solution handles edge cases gracefully.

### Explanation

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the `@file` tag?**
   - The `@file` tag is used to document the filename of the source code file. It helps in identifying the specific file when browsing through documentation generated by tools like Doxygen.

2. **Why is there a comment block starting with `/*Problem Statement:`?**
   - This comment block serves as a high-level description of the problem the code is intended to solve. It provides context and requirements for anyone reading the code.

3. **What is the significance of the `typedef struct` declaration?**
   - This declaration defines a new type called `RectangleDimensions` that represents a rectangle's area and perimeter. Using `typedef` makes it easier to work with this composite data type without needing to repeatedly specify `struct RectangleDimensions`.

4. **How does the `calculateAreaAndPerimeter` function signature relate to the problem statement?**
   - The function signature specifies the input parameters (`length` and `breadth`) and the return type (`RectangleDimensions`). It directly addresses the problem statement's requirement to calculate and return the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

5. **What is the role of the `getch()` function call?**
   - `getch()` is used to pause the console application until the user presses a key. It's often used in console applications to prevent the window from closing immediately after execution.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

- Lines 1-9: These lines contain a multi-line comment that serves as documentation for the file. It includes metadata about the file, author, version, date, and copyright information.
  
- Lines 11-48: This section contains the actual C code implementing the rectangle area and perimeter calculator. It starts with a detailed comment block describing the problem statement and requirements.

- Line 50: Includes the header file `main.h`. This is where the `RectangleDimensions` struct definition and possibly other necessary declarations or definitions are located.

- Lines 52-63: The `main` function begins. It declares four integer variables (`l`, `b`, `a`, `p`) to store the length, breadth, area, and perimeter of the rectangle.

- Lines 54-57: Prompts the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle and stores these values in `l` and `b`.

- Lines 58-59: Calculates the area (`a = l * b`) and perimeter (`p = 2 * (l + b)`) of the rectangle.

- Lines 60-61: Prints the calculated area and perimeter to the console.

- Line 62: Waits for the user to press a key before closing the console window due to the `getch()` function call.

#### Dry Run

Let's assume the user inputs `3` for both length and breadth.

- The program prompts the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
- The user enters `3`.
- The program then prompts the user to enter the breadth of the rectangle.
- The user enters `3`.
- The program calculates the area as `3 * 3 = 9` and the perimeter as `2 * (3 + 3) = 12`.
- The program prints "AREA:9" and "PERIMETER:12" to the console.
- The program waits for the user to press a key before exiting.

#### Additional Context

This code demonstrates basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and struct usage in C. It's a straightforward example of a console-based application that interacts with the user to perform a specific calculation. Understanding this code requires familiarity with C syntax, data types, and standard library functions for input/output (`printf`, `scanf`).
