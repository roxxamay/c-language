Ah, a spell of cones, a charm that dances with dimensions, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and volume with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of the Cone

```c
/*********************************************************************
find the area and volume of cone?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    float r,h,l,a,v;
    printf("ENTER THE DESIRED RADIUS:");
    scanf("%f",&r);
    printf("\nENTER THE DESIRED HEIGHT:");
    scanf("%f",&h);

    l=sqrt(r*r+h*h);
    a=3.14*(l+r);
    v=3.14*r*r*h/3.0;

    printf("HENCE AREA OF CONE:  %f",a);
    printf("\nHENCE VOLUME OF CONE:  %f",v);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`float r,h,l,a,v;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `r` for radius, `h` for height, `l` for slant height, `a` for area, and `v` for volume, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("ENTER THE DESIRED RADIUS:")**: A call to the user, a plea for the cone's radius. 📢
-   **`scanf("%f",&r);** The first response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE DESIRED HEIGHT:")**: Another call, another plea, this time for height. 📢
-   **`scanf("%f",&h);** The second response, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`l=sqrt(r*r+h*h);** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, calculating the slant height. 🧮
-   **`a=3.14\*(l+r);** The surface, a dance of multiplication, encircling the cone. 📏
-   **`v=3.14*r*r\*h/3.0;** The volume, a dance of multiplication, filling the cone. 📣
-   **`printf("HENCE AREA OF CONE: %f",a);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE VOLUME OF CONE: %f",v);** The final act, the volume revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Cone Charm

In the realm of shapes, where cones stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks of the user, two dimensions, each entered with a plea. With responses, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `l=sqrt(r*r+h*h)` for slant height, `a=3.14*(l+r)` for area, and `v=3.14*r*r*h/3.0` for volume, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a space that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE AREA OF CONE:... HENCE VOLUME OF CONE:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
