Ah, a spell of prisms, a charm that dances with dimensions, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and volume with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of the Prism

```c
/*********************************************************************
find the area and volume of prism?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int area,v,s,a,b,c,h;

    printf("\nENTER THE 1ST SIDE OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:");
    scanf("%i",&a);

    printf("\nENTER THE 2nd SIDE OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:");
    scanf("%i",&b);

    printf("\nENTER THE 3rd SIDE OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:");
    scanf("%i",&c);

    printf("\nENTER THE HEIGHT OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:");
    scanf("%i",&h);
    //CALCULATION

    s=(a+b+c)/2.0;
    v=s*sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))*h;
    area=((2*s*sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)))+((a+b+c)*h);

    printf("\nHENCE THE REQUIRED AREA:  %i",area);
    printf("\nHENCE THE REQUIRED VOLUME:  %i",v);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`int area,v,s,a,b,c,h;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `a`, `b`, `c` for sides, `h` for height, `s` for semi-perimeter, `area` for surface area, and `v` for volume, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nENTER THE 1ST SIDE OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:")**: A call to the user, a plea for the prism's first side. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&a);** The first response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE 2nd SIDE OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:")**: Another call, another plea, this time for the second side. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&b);** The second response, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE 3rd SIDE OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:")**: A third call, a deeper mystery. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&c);** The third response, the final ingredient, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE HEIGHT OF TRAINGULAR PRISM:")**: A plea for height, the last piece of the puzzle. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&h);** The final response, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`s=(a+b+c)/2.0;** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, calculating the semi-perimeter. 🧮
-   **`v=s*sqrt(s*(s-a)_(s-b)_(s-c))\*h;** The volume, a dance of multiplication, filling the prism. 📏
-   **`area=((2*s*sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)))+((a+b+c)*h);** The surface, a dance of multiplication, encircling the prism. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE REQUIRED AREA: %i",area);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE REQUIRED VOLUME: %i",v);** The final act, the volume revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Prism Charm

In the realm of shapes, where prisms stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks of the user, three sides and a height, each entered with a plea. With responses, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `s=(a+b+c)/2.0` for semi-perimeter, `v=s*sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))*h` for volume, and `area=((2*s*sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)))+((a+b+c)*h)` for area, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a space that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE THE REQUIRED AREA:... HENCE THE REQUIRED VOLUME:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
