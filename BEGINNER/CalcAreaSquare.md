### Code Explanation

#### Code Snippet

```c
#include"main.h"

int main() {
    int s, p, a;
    printf("LENGTH OF SIDE:  ");
    scanf("%i", &s);
    a = s * s;
    p = 4 * s;
    printf("\nHENCE THE AREA:  %i", a);
    printf("\n HENCE THE PERIMETER:  %i", p);
    getch();
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Include Directive**

   ```c
   #include"main.h"
   ```

   -  **Keyword**: `#include`
   -  **Concept**: Preprocessor directive
   -  **Explanation**: This directive tells the preprocessor to include the content of `main.h` before compiling the rest of the code. It's commonly used for including header files that contain definitions and declarations needed by the program.

2. **Function Declaration**

   ```c
   int main()
   ```

   -  **Keyword**: `int`
   -  **Concept**: Return type of a function
   -  **Explanation**: Specifies that the `main` function returns an integer value. In C, the `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.

3. **Variable Declarations**

   ```c
   int s, p, a;
   ```

   -  **Keyword**: `int`
   -  **Concept**: Data type
   -  **Explanation**: Declares three integer variables: `s` for the side length of a square, `p` for the perimeter, and `a` for the area.

4. **Input Output Function**

   ```c
   printf("LENGTH OF SIDE:  ");
   ```

   -  **Keyword**: `printf`
   -  **Concept**: Standard library function
   -  **Explanation**: Prints the string "LENGTH OF SIDE: " to the console. It's part of the standard I/O library in C.

5. **Input Output Function**

   ```c
   scanf("%i", &s);
   ```

   -  **Keyword**: `scanf`
   -  **Concept**: Standard library function
   -  **Explanation**: Reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. The `%i` format specifier indicates that an integer is expected.

6. **Arithmetic Operations**

   ```c
   a = s * s;
   p = 4 * s;
   ```

   -  **Concept**: Arithmetic operations
   -  **Explanation**: Calculates the area (`a`) by squaring the side length (`s`) and the perimeter (`p`) by multiplying the side length by 4.

7. **Input Output Function**

   ```c
   printf("\nHENCE THE AREA:  %i", a);
   printf("\n HENCE THE PERIMETER:  %i", p);
   ```

   -  **Concept**: String formatting and printing
   -  **Explanation**: Prints the calculated area and perimeter to the console. The `\n` character is used for a newline, and `%i` is a placeholder for integer values.

8. **Non-standard Library Function**
   ```c
   getch();
   ```
   -  **Concept**: Non-standard library function
   -  **Explanation**: Waits for a single character input from the user. This function is not part of the standard C library but was common in older compilers. Modern alternatives include `getchar()`.

#### Dry Run

1. Program starts.
2. `printf("LENGTH OF SIDE:  ");` prints "LENGTH OF SIDE: ".
3. User inputs a number, say `5`.
4. `scanf("%i", &s);` reads `5` and assigns it to `s`.
5. `a = s * s;` calculates `a` as `5 * 5 = 25`.
6. `p = 4 * s;` calculates `p` as `4 * 5 = 20`.
7. `printf("\nHENCE THE AREA:  %i", a);` prints "HENCE THE AREA: 25".
8. `printf("\n HENCE THE PERIMETER:  %i", p);` prints " HENCE THE PERIMETER: 20".
9. `getch();` waits for a key press.

#### Additional Context

This program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, user input/output handling, and the use of non-standard functions in C. Understanding these concepts is crucial for beginners starting with C programming.
