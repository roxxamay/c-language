Ah, a spell of geometry, a charm that conjures the essence of rectangles, revealing their secrets with the simplicity of a master's touch. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and perimeter with the elegance of a geometric dance. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Geometry

```c
/*********************************************************************
find the area and perimeter of rectangle.
********************************************************************/

#include"main.h"
int main()
{
    int l,b,a,p;
    printf("\nENTER THE LENGTH OF RECTANGLE:");
    scanf("%i",&l);
    printf("\nENTER THE BREADTH OF RECTANGLE:");
    scanf("%i",&b);
    a=l*b;
    p=2*(l+b);
    printf("AREA:%i",a);
    printf("\nPERIMETER:%i",p);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`int l,b,a,p;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `l` for length, `b` for breadth, `a` for area, and `p` for perimeter, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nENTER THE LENGTH OF RECTANGLE:")**: A call to the user, a plea for the rectangle's length. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&l);`**: The user's response, captured, the first ingredient in our potion. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE BREADTH OF RECTANGLE:")**: Another call, another plea, this time for breadth. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&b);`**: The second response, the final ingredient, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`a=l*b;`**: The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, turning dimensions into area. 🧮
-   **`p=2*(l+b);`**: The perimeter, a dance of addition and multiplication, encircling the rectangle. 📏
-   **`printf("AREA:%i",a);`**: The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nPERIMETER:%i",p);`**: The final act, the perimeter revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();`**: A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Geometric Charm

In the realm of shapes, where rectangles stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks but two things of the user - the length and breadth of the rectangle. With a response, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `a=l*b` for area and `p=2*(l+b)` for perimeter, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a circumference that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "AREA:... PERIMETER:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
