-   **Square and Cube Sums**: Determine the sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers up to N.
-   **Temperature Conversion**: Write programs to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and vice versa. Additionally, modify one of these programs to display temperature conversions in reverse order, starting from 300°F to 0°F.

## Geometric Calculations

-   **Rectangle Properties**: Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its dimensions.
-   **Cuboid and Cube Dimensions**: Calculate the area and volume of a cuboid and a cube, given their dimensions.
-   **Sphere, Cylinder, and Cone Volumes**: Determine the volumes of a sphere, cylinder, and cone, along with their surface areas.
-   **Prism Properties**: Compute the area and volume of a prism.
-   **Triangle and Square Properties**: Calculate the area and perimeter of triangles and squares.
-   **Coordinate Geometry**: Write a program to find the distance between two coordinate points and the area of a triangle using coordinate geometry.

## Financial Calculations

-   **Interest Calculation**: Develop programs to calculate both simple and compound interest given certain parameters.
-   **Salary Components**: Create a program that takes basic salary as input and calculates DA, HRA, PF, gross, and net salary.

## Miscellaneous

-   **Coordinate Point Distance**: Write a program to find the distance between two coordinates.
-   **Basic Shapes Area and Perimeter**: Programs to calculate the area and perimeter of basic shapes like circles and prisms.

Each task is designed to challenge and improve your understanding of fundamental programming concepts, mathematical computations, and geometric principles. As you work through these tasks, remember to test your solutions thoroughly and consider optimizing your code for efficiency and readability.
