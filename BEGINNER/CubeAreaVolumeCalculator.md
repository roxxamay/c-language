Title: Calculate Area and Volume of a Cube

Description:

You are given a cube with its side length provided as an integer. Your task is to calculate and return both the surface area and the volume of the cube.

Input:

A single integer sideLength representing the length of one side of the cube.
Output:

Two integers, where the first integer represents the surface area of the cube and the second integer represents the volume of the cube.
Example:

If sideLength = 3, then the output should be [36, 27]. The surface area of a cube with side length 3 is (6 \times 3^2 = 54), but since the problem asks for the surface area only considering one face, it's (3^2 = 9) per face times 6 faces equals 54. The volume of the cube is (3^3 = 27).
Constraints:

The given sideLength will be in the range [1, 100].
Note: The surface area calculation considers all six faces of the cube.

#### Explanation

1. **Comments and Documentation**:

   -  The code begins with a multi-line comment block that serves as documentation. This includes the file name, author, brief description, version, date, and copyright information. It also contains a detailed explanation of the task, input, output, example, and constraints.
   -  Another comment block titled "find the cube?" provides a brief overview of the task at hand.

2. **Include Directive**:

   -  `#include"main.h"`: This directive tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the header file named `main.h`. Header files typically contain function declarations, macro definitions, and other information needed across multiple source files.

3. **Main Function**:

   -  `int main()`: The main function is the entry point of every C program. It returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the program's execution.

4. **Variable Declaration**:

   -  Inside the main function, three integer variables `s`, `a`, and `v` are declared. These represent the side length of the cube (`s`), the surface area (`a`), and the volume (`v`) respectively.

5. **User Input**:

   -  `printf("\nENTER THE LENGTH OF SIDE OF CUBE");`: This statement prints a prompt asking the user to enter the side length of the cube.
   -  `scanf("%i",&s);`: This statement reads the user's input from the standard input (keyboard) and stores it in the variable `s`.

6. **Calculations**:

   -  `v=s*s*s;`: Calculates the volume of the cube by cubing the side length.
   -  `a=6*s*s;`: Calculates the surface area of the cube by squaring the side length and multiplying by 6 (since a cube has 6 faces).

7. **Output**:

   -  `printf("\nHENCE AREA=%i",a);`: Prints the calculated surface area of the cube.
   -  `printf("\nHENCE VOLUME=%i",v);`: Prints the calculated volume of the cube.

8. **getch()**:
   -  `getch();`: This function waits for the user to press a key before continuing. It's often used in console applications to prevent the window from closing immediately after execution.

#### Dry Run

Let's assume the user inputs `3` when prompted for the side length of the cube.

-  The program prompts the user to enter the side length of the cube.
-  The user enters `3`.
-  The volume `v` is calculated as `3*3*3 = 27`.
-  The surface area `a` is calculated as `6*3*3 = 54`.
-  The program prints the surface area as `54`.
-  The program prints the volume as `27`.
-  The program waits for the user to press a key before exiting.

This code demonstrates basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and control flow in C programming.
