Ah, a spell of triangles, a charm that dances with sides, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and perimeter with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Triangles

```c
/*********************************************************************
write program to find area and perimeter of triangle?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int a,b,c,s,p,ar;
    printf("\nENTER THE 1ST SIDE OF TRIANGLE:  ");
    scanf("%i",&a);
    printf("\nENTER THE 2ND SIDE OF TRIANGLE:  ");
    scanf("%i",&b);
    printf("\nENTER THE 3RD SIDE OF TRIANGLE:  ");
    scanf("%i",&c);
    //calculation
    s=(a+b+c)/2;
    ar=sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c));
    p=a+b+c;
    printf("\nHENCE THE AREA:  %i",ar);
    printf("\nHENCE THE PERIMETER:  %i",p);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`int a,b,c,s,p,ar;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `a`, `b`, `c` for sides, `s` for semi-perimeter, `p` for perimeter, and `ar` for area, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nENTER THE 1ST SIDE OF TRIANGLE: ");** A call to the user, a plea for the first side. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&a);** The first response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE 2ND SIDE OF TRIANGLE: ");** Another call, another plea, this time for the second side. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&b);** The second response, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`printf("\nENTER THE 3RD SIDE OF TRIANGLE: ");** A third call, a deeper mystery. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&c);** The third response, the final ingredient, setting the stage for the grand reveal. 🖱️
-   **`s=(a+b+c)/2;** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, calculating the semi-perimeter. 🧮
-   **`ar=sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)\*(s-c));** The area, a dance of multiplication, filling the triangle. 📏
-   **`p=a+b+c;** The perimeter, a dance of addition, encircling the triangle. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE AREA: %i",ar);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE PERIMETER: %i",p);** The final act, the perimeter revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Triangle Charm

In the realm of shapes, where triangles stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks of the user, three sides, each entered with a plea. With responses, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `s=(a+b+c)/2` for semi-perimeter and `ar=sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)` for area, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a boundary that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE THE AREA:... HENCE THE PERIMETER:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
