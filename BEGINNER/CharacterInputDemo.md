    printf("Enter your first character: ");
    a = getch();

    printf("Enter your second character: ");
    b = getche();

    printf("Enter your third character: ");
    c = getchar();

    printf("Enter your fourth character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &d);

    printf("\na=%c\nb=%c\nc=%c\nd=%c", a, b, c, d);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What does `#include <stdio.h>` mean?**

   -  This line includes the Standard Input Output library in the program. It provides functionalities for input/output operations like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **What is the purpose of `int main()`?**

   -  This is the entry point of the C program. When the program starts, control begins at the `main()` function.

3. **What does `char a, b, c, d;` declare?**

   -  This declares four variables of type `char`. These variables are used to store the characters inputted by the user.

4. **How does `printf` work?**

   -  `printf` is a function that sends formatted output to stdout (usually the screen). It's used here to prompt the user for input.

5. **What is the difference between `getch()` and `getche()`?**

   -  Both are functions that read a single character from the keyboard. `getch()` does not echo the character back to the screen, while `getche()` does.

6. **Why is there a space in `" %c"` in the `scanf` call?**

   -  The space allows `scanf` to skip any whitespace characters (like spaces or newlines) that might be in the input buffer. This prevents unexpected behavior when the next character is read.

7. **What does `return 0;` signify?**
   -  It signifies successful termination of the program. Returning 0 from `main()` indicates that the program has executed successfully.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

-  `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the standard I/O library, necessary for input/output operations.
-  `int main()` { ... }: Defines the main function where the program starts execution.
-  `char a, b, c, d;`: Declares four character variables to store the user's input.
-  `printf("Enter your first character: ");`: Prompts the user to enter the first character.
-  `a = getch();`: Reads the first character without echoing it back to the screen.
-  `printf("Enter your second character: ");`: Prompts the user to enter the second character.
-  `b = getche();`: Reads the second character and echoes it back to the screen.
-  `printf("Enter your third character: ");`: Prompts the user to enter the third character.
-  `c = getchar();`: Reads the third character from the keyboard and returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int.
-  `printf("Enter your fourth character: ");`: Prompts the user to enter the fourth character.
-  `scanf(" %c", &d);`: Reads the fourth character from the input, skipping any leading whitespace.
-  `printf("\na=%c\nb=%c\nc=%c\nd=%c", a, b, c, d);`: Prints the collected characters in the specified format.
-  `return 0;`: Indicates successful completion of the program.

#### Dry Run

Let's assume the user inputs 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'.

1. `a = getch();` - User presses 'A'. 'A' is stored in `a`.
2. `b = getche();` - User presses 'B'. 'B' is displayed on the screen and stored in `b`.
3. `c = getchar();` - User presses 'C'. 'C' is stored in `c`.
4. `scanf(" %c", &d);` - User presses 'D'. 'D' is stored in `d`.
5. `printf("\na=%c\nb=%c\nc=%c\nd=%c", a, b, c, d);` - Prints `a=A, b=B, c=C, d=D`.

#### Additional Context

This program is a simple demonstration of how to capture and display character inputs in C using various functions. It's designed to help beginners understand the differences between `getch()`, `getche()`, `getchar()`, and `scanf()` for reading characters from the keyboard.
