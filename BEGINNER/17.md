Ah, a spell of squares, a charm that dances with sides, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and perimeter with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Squares

```c
/*********************************************************************
write program to find area and perimeter of square?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int s,p,a;
    printf("LENGTH OF SIDE:  ");
    scanf("%i",&s);
    a=s*s;
    p=4*s;
    printf("\nHENCE THE AREA:  %i",a);
    printf("\n HENCE THE PERIMETER:  %i",p);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
   - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

- **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

- **`int s,p,a;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `s` for side, `p` for perimeter, and `a` for area, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

- **`printf("LENGTH OF SIDE:  ");** A call to the user, a plea for the square's side. 📢
- **`scanf("%i",&s);** The response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
- **`a=s*s;** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, calculating the area. 🧮
- **`p=4*s;** The perimeter, a dance of multiplication, encircling the square. 📏
- **`printf("\nHENCE THE AREA:  %i",a);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
- **`printf("\n HENCE THE PERIMETER:  %i",p);** The final act, the perimeter revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
- **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Square Charm

In the realm of shapes, where squares stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks but one thing of the user - the length of a side. With a response, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `a=s*s` for area and `p=4*s` for perimeter, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a boundary that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE THE AREA:... HENCE THE PERIMETER:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
