/*Problem Statement:

Given a positive integer N, write a function to calculate the sum of all natural numbers up to N. The formula for the sum of the first N natural numbers is N * (N + 1) / 2.

Function Signature:

int sum_of_natural_numbers(int N);
Input:

A single integer N representing the upper limit of the natural numbers.
Output:

An integer representing the sum of all natural numbers up to N.
Example:

If N = 5, the function should return 15 because the sum of the first 5 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) is 15.
Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^4
The input N is always a positive integer.
Notes:

Your solution should have a time complexity of O(1), meaning it should not depend on the size of N to compute the sum.
Hint:

Consider using the arithmetic series formula mentioned above.
Solution: Write a C function named sum_of_natural_numbers that takes an integer N as its parameter and returns the sum of all natural numbers up to N according to the specified formula.

#### Explanation

1. **File Header Comments**: Lines 1-9 provide metadata about the file, including the author, date, and copyright information. This is standard practice in software development to document the purpose and ownership of the code.

2. **Problem Statement**: Lines 12-39 describe the problem the code is intended to solve. It explains the task of calculating the sum of natural numbers up to a given number `N` using the arithmetic series formula.

3. **Include Directives**: Lines 41-44 include necessary header files for the program. `conio.h` provides console I/O functions, `math.h` for mathematical operations, and `stdio.h` for standard input/output operations.

4. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point of the C program. Inside this function:
   -  Two integer variables `n` and `s` are declared. `n` will hold the desired number of terms, and `s` will store the calculated sum.
   -  `s` is initialized to 0.
   -  The program prompts the user to enter the desired number of terms.
   -  The entered value is read into `n`.
   -  The sum of natural numbers up to `n` is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` and stored in `s`.
   -  The calculated sum is printed to the console.
   -  `getch()` waits for a key press before closing the console window, ensuring the user can see the result.

#### Dry Run

Let's assume the user enters `5` when prompted for the desired number of terms.

-  `n` is set to `5`.
-  The formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` calculates the sum of natural numbers up to `5`. So, `s = 5 * (5 + 1) / 2 = 15`.
-  The program prints `SUM=15`.

This demonstrates how the program calculates and displays the sum of natural numbers up to a given number efficiently using the arithmetic series formula, adhering to the requirement of having a time complexity of O(1).
