Problem Statement
Title: Calculate the Sum of Cubes
Difficulty: Easy

Description:

Write a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the cubes of all natural numbers from 1 to n.

Example:

Input: n = 3
Output: 36 (because 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36)

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4

Notes:

This problem tests your understanding of arithmetic series and the concept of cubing numbers. Pay attention to the constraints to ensure your solution runs efficiently.

Function Signature:

int sumOfCubes(int n);

Requirements:

Your implementation should have a time complexity of O(n).
You must handle the case where n is outside the specified range.

Hint:

Consider using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers and then cube the result. Alternatively, calculate the sum directly using a loop.

#### Explanation

1. **Comments and Documentation**: The code begins with a block comment that serves as documentation for the file `SumOfCubes.c`. It includes metadata about the file, author, version, date, and copyright information. This is followed by a more detailed problem statement and requirements for implementing a function named `sumOfCubes`.

2. **Include Directive**: `#include"main.h"`: This directive tells the preprocessor to include the contents of `main.h` in the program. This header file likely contains declarations and definitions needed by the program, such as function prototypes, macros, and constants.

3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point of the C program. It defines the scope within which a program executes.

4. **Variable Declaration**: Inside `main()`, two integer variables `n` and `s` are declared. `n` will store the number of terms for which the sum of cubes needs to be calculated, and `s` will store the result.

5. **User Input**: `printf("ENTER THE DESIRED NUMBERS OF TERMS:")`: This line prompts the user to enter the desired number of terms. `scanf("%i",&n);` reads the user's input and stores it in `n`.

6. **Calculation of Sum of Cubes**: The calculation `s=(n*(n+1)/2)*(n*(n+1)/2);` computes the sum of cubes indirectly. Instead of directly computing the cube of each number from 1 to `n`, it uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared. This approach simplifies the computation but might not be intuitive for beginners.

7. **Alternative Calculation**: The commented-out line suggests another method using the power function to compute the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is equivalent to the cube of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

8. **Display Result**: `printf("SUM:%i",s);` prints the computed sum of cubes to the console.

9. **Waiting for User Input**: `getch();` waits for the user to press a key before terminating the program. This is often used in console applications to prevent the window from closing immediately after execution.

#### Dry Run

Let's assume the user enters `3` when prompted. Here's a step-by-step execution:

1. `n` is set to `3`.
2. The calculation `s=(n*(n+1)/2)*(n*(n+1)/2)` becomes `s=(3*4/2)*(3\*4/
