Problem Statement: Sum of Squares of First N Natural Numbers
Problem Description:
Write a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.
Example:
Input: n = 3
Output: 14 (since 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14)
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10000
Notes:
This problem tests your understanding of arithmetic progressions and the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers.
Function Signature:
int sum_of_squares(int n);
Explanation:
The formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is given by (âˆ‘(i=1 to n) i^2). Implement this formula in your solution.
Testing:
Your implementation should pass all the hidden unit tests to ensure it works correctly across the entire range of valid inputs.

#### Explanation

1. **Comments and Documentation**: The code begins with a block comment providing metadata about the file, including the author, date, and a brief description of the problem being solved. This is followed by a more detailed problem statement and explanation of the task at hand, including the expected input and output, constraints, and a hint towards the mathematical formula to be implemented.

2. **Include Directive**: `#include"main.h"`: This directive tells the preprocessor to include the contents of `main.h` in the program. This header file likely contains declarations and definitions needed by the program, such as function prototypes, macros, and constants.

3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point of the C program. It is where the execution of the program starts.

4. **Variable Declaration**: Inside `main()`, two integer variables `n` and `s` are declared. `n` will hold the number of terms for which the sum of squares needs to be calculated, and `s` will store the result.

5. **User Input**: `printf("ENTER THE DESIRED NUMBERS OF TERMS:")`: This line prompts the user to enter the desired number of terms. `scanf("%i",&n);`: This reads the user's input from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and stores it in the variable `n`.

6. **Calculation**: `s = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6;`: This line calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula mentioned in the problem statement. The formula is derived from the arithmetic progression of natural numbers and simplifies the process of finding the sum of squares.

7. **Output**: `printf("\nSUM:%i",s);`: This prints the calculated sum to the standard output (usually the console).

8. **getch()**: This function waits for the user to press a key before terminating the program. It's often used in console applications to prevent the window from closing immediately after execution.

#### Dry Run

Let's assume the user enters `3` when prompted for the number of terms.

-  `n` is set to `3`.
-  Calculate `s` using the formula: `s = 3*(3+1)*(2*3+1)/6 = 3*4*7/6 = 84/6 = 14`.
-  Print `SUM:14`.

#### Additional Context

This program demonstrates the application of mathematical formulas in programming to solve problems efficiently. Understanding arithmetic progressions and how to apply mathematical formulas in code is crucial for solving a wide range of problems, especially in competitive programming and algorithm design.
