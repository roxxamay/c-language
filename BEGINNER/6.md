Ah, a spell of revelation, a charm that dances with a single digit, revealing its essence with the simplicity of a scribe's hand. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of input and echo with the elegance of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Echo

```c
/*********************************************************************
print the value of n where n=?.
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int n;

   printf("\nINPUT THE DESIRED NUMBER:");
   scanf("%i",&n);
   printf("THE NUMBER IS:%d",n);
   getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`int n;`**: The declaration of our vessel, `n`, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nINPUT THE DESIRED NUMBER:")**: A call to the user, a plea for a number, the first ingredient in our potion. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&n);`**: The user's response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`printf("THE NUMBER IS:%d",n);`**: The revelation, the number unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`getch();`**: A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳
