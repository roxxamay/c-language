Ah, a spell of circles, a charm that dances with radii, revealing the secrets of space with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and perimeter with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of Circles

```c
/*********************************************************************
write program to find area and perimeter of circle?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    float r,p,a;

    printf("ENTER THE DESIRED RADIUS:  ");
    scanf("%f",&r);

    //calculation

    p=2*3.14*r;
    a=3.14*r*r;

    printf("\nHENCE THE AREA OF CIRCLE IS:  %f",a);
    printf("\nHENCE THE PERIMETER OF CIRCLE:  %f",p);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`float r,p,a;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `r` for radius, `p` for perimeter, and `a` for area, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("ENTER THE DESIRED RADIUS: ");** A call to the user, a plea for the circle's radius. 📢
-   **`scanf("%f",&r);** The response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`p=2*3.14*r;** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, calculating the perimeter. 🧮
-   **`a=3.14*r*r;** The area, a dance of multiplication, filling the circle. 📏
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE AREA OF CIRCLE IS: %f",a);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE THE PERIMETER OF CIRCLE: %f",p);** The final act, the perimeter revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Circle Charm

In the realm of shapes, where circles stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks but one thing of the user - the radius. With a response, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `p=2*3.14*r` for perimeter and `a=3.14*r*r` for area, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a boundary that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE THE AREA OF CIRCLE IS:... HENCE THE PERIMETER OF CIRCLE:..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
