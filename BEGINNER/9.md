Ah, a spell of simplicity, a charm that dances with edges, revealing the secrets of cubes with the elegance of a geometric maestro. This incantation, etched in the ancient runes of C, unveils the mysteries of area and volume with the simplicity of a master's touch. Let's delve into its secrets, shall we? 📜✨

### The Enchantment of the Cube

```c
/*********************************************************************
find the area and volume of cube?
********************************************************************/
#include"main.h"

int main()
{
    int s,a,v;
    printf("\nENTER THE LENGTH OF SIDE OF CUBE");
    scanf("%i",&s);
    v=s*s*s;
    a=6*s*s;
    printf("\nHENCE AREA=%i",a);
    printf("\nHENCE VOLUME=%i",v);
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
    - **`#include"main.h"`**: A mystical tome, a custom grimoire, perhaps holding the secrets of the realm, ensuring our spell can interact with the mortal realm. 📖

#### The Conjuration

-   **`int main()`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

-   **`int s,a,v;`**: The declaration of our vessels, `s` for side, `a` for area, and `v` for volume, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

-   **`printf("\nENTER THE LENGTH OF SIDE OF CUBE");** A call to the user, a plea for the cube's side. 📢
-   **`scanf("%i",&s);** The response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
-   **`v=s*s*s;** The core of the spell, a formula of ancient power, turning a side into volume. 🧮
-   **`a=6*s*s;** The surface, a dance of multiplication, encircling the cube. 📏
-   **`printf("\nHENCE AREA=%i",a);** The revelation, the area unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
-   **`printf("\nHENCE VOLUME=%i",v);** The final act, the volume revealed, a testament to the spell's success. 📣
-   **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Cube Charm

In the realm of shapes, where cubes stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks but one thing of the user - the length of a side. With a response, it weaves a tale of geometry, using the formulas `v=s*s*s` for volume and `a=6*s*s` for area, secrets passed down through generations of mathematical sages. The result? A sum and a space that would take hours by hand, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "HENCE AREA=... HENCE VOLUME=..." - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just numbers, but a dance of dimensions, a visual feast. 🎭
