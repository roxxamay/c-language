### The Enchantment of Primes

```c
//THIS PROGRAM IS CREATED BY @ROXXADIIII

#include"stdio.h"
#include"conio.h"

int main(void)
{
    int x;
    printf("\nENTER THE NUMBER:");
    scanf("%d",&x);
    if(x%x==0||x%1==0)
    {
        printf("\n%d IS A PRIME NUMBER",x);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("\n%d IS NOT A PRIME NUMBER",x);
    }
    getch();
}
```

#### The Ritual Begins

1. **The Gathering of Ingredients**:
   - **`#include"stdio.h"`**: A mystical tome for the basic arts of input and output, a staple in any wizard's library. 📖
   - **`#include"conio.h"`**: A grimoire for capturing the essence of interaction, ensuring our spell can pause and reflect. 📚

#### The Conjuration

- **`int main(void)`**: The heart of our spell, where the magic happens. A place of power, a nexus of creation. 🌟

#### The Incantation Unfolds

- **`int x;** The declaration of our vessel, `x`, awaiting the spark of life. 🧪

- **`printf("\nENTER THE NUMBER:");** A call to the user, a plea for a number, the first ingredient in our potion. 📢
- **`scanf("%d",&x);** The user's response, captured, the essence of the spell. 🖱️
- **`if(x%x==0||x%1==0)** The core of the spell, a condition of ancient power, testing for primality. 🧮
- **`printf("\n%d IS A PRIME NUMBER",x);** The revelation, the prime unveiled, a display of magical prowess. 📣
- **`else { printf("\n%d IS NOT A PRIME NUMBER",x); }** The final act, the non-prime revealed, a testament to the spell's discernment. 📣
- **`getch();** A pause, a moment to marvel at the result, before the spell fades. ⏳

### The Tale of the Prime Charm

In the realm of numbers, where primes stand tall and proud, there exists a spell of such simplicity it turns the complex into the trivial. This charm, a mere snippet in the grand tapestry of code, yet a marvel in its efficiency. It asks but one thing of the user - a number. With a response, it weaves a tale of logic, using the condition `x%x==0||x%1==0`, a secret passed down through generations of programmers. The result? A declaration of primality, delivered in the blink of an eye. 🐌➡️🚀

### The Last Standard Out

The code's last whisper, a testament to its success, echoes in the ether: "Code output goes here... (press run)" - a promise of what's to come, a hint of the magic within. Imagine the output, not just a declaration, but a dance of logic, a visual feast. 🎭
