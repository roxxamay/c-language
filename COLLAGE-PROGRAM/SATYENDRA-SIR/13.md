Alright, let's dive into this C program with a humorous and detailed breakdown ðŸš€

```c
// 13) write a program to solve : (x+y+z)/x*x
```

Line 1: The programmer's note to themselves, like a secret message in a bottle thrown into the sea of code. It says, "Hey, remember? We need to calculate (x + y + z) divided by x squared."

```c
#include"stdio.h"
#include"math.h"
#include"stdio.h"
```

Lines 3-5: Here we have a bit of a mix-up. Including `stdio.h` twice is like ordering two pizzas when you only wanted one. The `math.h` inclusion is like bringing a knife to a gunfight â€“ it's not needed here but could be useful in other scenarios.

```c
int main(void)
{
    int x,y,z;
    float a;
```

Lines 7-9: The stage is set. We have three integers (`x`, `y`, `z`) ready to play their part in our little mathematical drama, and a floating-point number (`a`) waiting in the wings to hold our final answer.

```c
printf("\nENTER THREE DESIRABLE NUMBER:");
scanf("%d%d%d",&x,&y,&z);
```

Lines 11-13: The curtain rises. The stage manager (the `printf` function) calls out, "Enter three desirable numbers!" And the audience (the user) responds by typing in their magical numbers, which are then stored in the boxes labeled `x`, `y`, and `z`.

```c
a=(x+y+z)/(x*x);
```

Line 16: The magic happens. Our wizard (the programmer) takes the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z`, divides it by the square of `x`, and stores the result in the crystal ball labeled `a`. This is akin to performing a complex spell while juggling chainsaws.

```c
printf("\na=(x+y+z)/(x*x)=%f",a);
getch();
```

Lines 18-20: The wizard steps away from the cauldron, revealing the potion they've brewed. "Behold," they say, "the result of our mystical calculation!" And then, just as quickly as they appeared, they vanish, leaving behind a single key pressed by the `getch()` function, which seems to unlock the door to the next adventure.

And there we have it A tale as old as time, a story as classic as... well, any classic story you'd care to mention. Remember, coding is not just about solving problems; it's about creating magic spells and potions, and sometimes, accidentally setting things on fire. Happy coding, my fellow wizards and witches
