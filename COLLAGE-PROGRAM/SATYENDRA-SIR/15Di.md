Prepare thyself for a grand adventure through the labyrinthine corridors of strings and character arrays in C Our mission? To copy one string to another using pointers. 🏰🔍

```c
/*
18) write a program to copy one string to another using pointers.
*/
```
Line 1: Our hero, clad in the finest armor of knowledge, stands before the gates of the labyrinth. The challenge? To replicate the essence of one string into another, guided solely by the light of pointers. 🌟📜

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<conio.h>
```
Lines 3-5: Before venturing into the labyrinth, our hero ensures he has the necessary tools. `stdio.h` for standard input/output, `string.h` for string manipulation functions (though not strictly necessary for this task, it's included for educational purposes), and `conio.h` for console I/O (more commonly used in older systems). These are the keys to unlocking the secrets of string copying. 🔑🌐

```c
int main(void)
{
    char src[50], dest[50];
```
Lines 7-9: The stage is set. Our hero declares two character arrays, `src` and `dest`, each capable of holding a string of up to 50 characters. `src` will be the original string, and `dest` will be the replica we aim to create. 📜🏞️

```c
printf("Enter source string: ");
gets(src);
```
Line 11: The call goes out. "Enter the source string!" The echo of the user's response fills the air, and the string is stored safely within `src`. 📢📝

```c
strcpy(dest, src);
```
Line 13: With a flick of the wand, our hero casts a spell, making `dest` a carbon copy of `src`. It's as if the very essence of `src` were transferred to `dest` in an instant. ✨🔮

```c
printf("Copied string is: %s", dest);
getch();
return 0;
}
```
Lines 15-19: With the last echo fading, our hero presents the fruits of their labor. "Behold, the copied string!" he proclaims, displaying the replicated content for all to see. Then, he retreats, ready for the next adventure. 🌟🔭

Thus, our tale of string replication comes to a close. Remember, in the vast expanse of programming, mastering the art of string manipulation is akin to mastering the art of illusion. May your strings always duplicate flawlessly, and may your pointers forever guide you true. Until we meet again, happy coding, cunning coder
