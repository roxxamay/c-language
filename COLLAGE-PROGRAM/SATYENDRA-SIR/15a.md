Welcome back to our coding saga Today, we venture into the realm of logic puzzles with a focus on bitwise operators. Specifically, we'll tackle the task of determining whether a number is even or odd using bitwise operations. 🧙‍♂️🔍

```c
/*
15) determine whether a number is even or odd using bitwise operators.
*/
```
Line 1: Our hero, armed with a riddle, embarks on a quest to decipher the mysteries of binary and bitwise operations. The riddle: "Is this number even or odd?"

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
```
Lines 3-5: Gathering supplies for the journey, our hero equips himself with `stdio.h` for standard input/output, `conio.h` for console I/O (though less common nowadays), and `stdlib.h` for general purpose functions. These tools are essential for navigating the challenges ahead. 🛡️📚

```c
int main(void)
{
    int num;
```
Line 7: At the dawn of the quest, our hero prepares a vessel to hold the number that will be tested. This vessel is named `num`.

```c
printf("enter a number:");
scanf("%d",&num);
```
Lines 9-10: The call goes out across the lands. "Enter a number!" The response echoes back, and the chosen number is placed within the vessel `num`, ready for inspection. 👁️📝

```c
//calculation
```
Line 12: The moment of truth approaches. Our hero, with a deep breath, performs the ancient ritual of bitwise operations to uncover the truth. 🧙‍♂️✨

```c
if(num & 1)
    printf("%d is odd.",num);
else
    printf("%d is even.",num);
```
Lines 14-15: With a flick of the wrist, our hero uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to test the least significant bit of the number. If it's set (1), the number is odd; otherwise, it's even. The verdict is proclaimed to all who seek it. 📢🔮

```c
getch();
return 0;
}
```
Lines 16-18: Our hero, satisfied with the wisdom imparted, awaits further challenges. The console remains open, ready for the next command. 🕹️🔄

Thus concludes our tale of bitwise bravery. Remember, in the world of programming, understanding the fundamentals of bitwise operations can unlock secrets hidden in plain sight. May your code always run smoothly, and may your logic never falter. Until our paths cross again, happy coding, intrepid coder
