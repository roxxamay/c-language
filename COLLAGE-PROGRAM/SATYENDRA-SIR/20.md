Alright, let's dive into this C program with a humorous and detailed explanation, complete with ASCII art where appropriate 🚀

```c
//20)WAP TO FIND THE ROOT OF THE X.
```
Line 1: This comment tells us what our program does. It's like saying, "Hey, I'm going to write a program that finds the square root of a number." But in a more formal way. 😎

```c
#include"stdio.h"
#include"conio.h"
#include"math.h"
```
Lines 2-4: These lines are including libraries. Think of them as bringing in a toolbox full of tools we need to build our program. `stdio.h` is for standard input/output operations (like printing stuff out), `conio.h` is for console input/output (a bit outdated but still used in some places), and `math.h` is for mathematical functions, which we'll definitely need for finding roots. 🧰🔧

```c
int main(void)
{
    short int y,i;
```
Lines 6-8: Here, we're declaring the main function, which is the starting point of our program. Inside it, we declare two variables: `y`, which will hold the number we want to find the root of, and `i`, which will be our little helper in the loop that follows. It's like saying, "I'm about to start my adventure, and I've packed my trusty sidekick, i."

```c
printf("\nENTER THE VALUE TO FIND ROOT:");
scanf("%hd",&y);
```
Lines 9-11: We ask the user to enter a value, then we store that value in `y`. It's like asking someone, "Can you tell me how many cookies you'd like?" Then you remember how many they said so you can bake that many. 🍪✨

```c
for(i=1;i<=y/2;i++)
{
    if((i*i)==y)
    {
        printf("\nROOT OF %hd IS %hd",y,i);
        break;
    }
}
```
Lines 14-21: Here's where the magic happens. We start a loop that goes from 1 up to half of the number entered by the user. In each iteration, we check if squaring the current number (`i`) equals the original number (`y`). If it does, we found the root, print it out, and stop the loop. It's like searching for your lost sock in the laundry basket until you find it. 🧼👕

```c
getch();
```
Line 23: Finally, we wait for the user to press a key before the program ends. It's like saying, "Don't go yet There's one last thing... press any key to exit." 🖥️💻

### Outcome:

If you run this program and enter a perfect square (like 16), it will quickly find and print the root (in this case, 4). However, if you enter a non-perfect square, it might take a while because it checks every number up to half of your input. For example, if you enter 50, it will check 1 through 25 before finally giving up because none of those numbers squared equal 50.

Remember, this program only works for positive integers. If you try to find the root of a negative number or a decimal, it won't behave as expected. So, stick to positive integers for the best experience
