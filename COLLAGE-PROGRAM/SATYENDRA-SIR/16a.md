Ahoy Let's embark on another magical journey through the code seas, this time navigating the treacherous waters of pattern printing with stars ðŸŒŸ. Buckle up, matey, because we're about to chart a course through the uncharted territories of nested loops and conditional statements!

```c
// differnt types of figure with *
```

This comment is like the treasure map leading us to the X marks the spot of our adventure. It hints at the treasure we seek: figures made of stars. But alas, the map is slightly off. It should read "different types of figures with \*". Ah well, every adventurer knows that maps are often misleading. ðŸ˜‰

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "conio.h"
```

Here, we're gathering our tools: the `stdio.h` for communication with the outside world (telling the computer what to do) and `conio.h` for special console functions (like a secret handshake with the computer). It's like preparing our magical compass and enchanted quill.

```c
int main(void)
{
    auto short int i,j,n;
```

Setting sail with our crew members: `i`, `j`, and `n`. `i` and `j` are our navigators, guiding us through the nested loops, while `n` is our captain, steering us towards the number of lines we wish to print.

```c
printf("\nENTER THE NUMBER OF LINES:");
scanf("%hd",&n);
```

This is like asking the sea itself how many islands we shall visit. The sea responds, and we adjust our course accordingly. We're collecting the number of lines we want to print, which is like deciding how many times we'll dip our flag into the sand.

```c
for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
{
    for(j=1;j<=i;j++)
    {
        printf("*");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

Now, we're entering the heart of the storm. Two nested loops, like two ships sailing together, each carrying a cargo of stars. The outer loop (`i`) decides how many islands (lines) we'll visit, while the inner loop (`j`) determines how many flags (stars) we'll plant on each island. With each iteration, we add more stars to our island until it's covered, then move on to the next one. It's a beautiful sight, truly.

```c
getch();
```

Finally, after our grand voyage, we pause, taking a moment to appreciate the view before setting sail again. `getch()` is like waiting for the last wave goodbye before turning our ship around.

And so, our adventure concludes. We've successfully navigated the treacherous waters of nested loops and printed patterns of stars. Remember, every great explorer knows that the journey is as important as the destination. So, keep exploring, keep coding, and may your compiler never throw errors at you
