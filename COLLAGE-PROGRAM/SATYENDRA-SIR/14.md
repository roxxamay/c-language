Ahoy Let's embark on another coding adventure, this time diving into the depths of a simple yet profound question: "if the basic salary and net salary is given find out the percentage of increase." 🏴‍☠️

```c
/*
14) if the basic salary and net salary is given find out the percentage of increasement.
*/
```

Line 1: Ah, the quest begins. Our brave hero (the programmer) sets forth to conquer the dragon of a simple problem: calculating the percentage increase between a basic salary and its net counterpart. 🐉

```c
#include"stdio.h"
#include"conio.h"
#include"math.h"
```

Lines 3-5: In the land of includes, our hero gathers his trusty companions: `stdio.h` for the standard input/output functions, `conio.h` for console I/O operations (though it's more common in DOS environments), and `math.h` for mathematical operations. Together, they form the mighty sword of knowledge. 📖✨

```c
int main(void)
{
    int bs,ns;
    float x;
```

Lines 7-9: Our hero prepares his arsenal. Two integers, `bs` and `ns`, will hold the basic and net salaries respectively. A floating-point number, `x`, will be the vessel for the magical formula that calculates the percentage increase. 🛡️🧙‍♂️

```c
printf("\nENTER THE BASIC SALARY:");
scanf("%d",&bs);
printf("\nENTER THE NET SALARY:");
scanf("%d",&ns);
```

Lines 11-13: The call goes out. "Hear ye, hear ye Enter the basic salary!" And then, "Enter the net salary!" The villagers (users) respond, their answers echoing through the valleys of code. 🗣️👥

```c
//calculation
```

Line 15: The moment of truth arrives. Our hero unsheathes his mighty sword (the formula) and prepares to strike. 🗡️⚔️

```c
x=((ns-bs)*100)/bs;
```

Line 17: With a swift motion, he calculates the percentage increase, storing the result in the vessel `x`. It's like alchemy, turning raw data into pure gold. 💰🌈

```c
printf("\n%f is the percentage of increasement",x);
getch();
```

Lines 19-21: The hero reveals his treasure, the calculated percentage increase, to all who seek it. "Behold!" he cries, "The magic number that tells us how much you've grown!" Then, he waits, ready for the next challenge. 🎯🕹️

And so, our tale ends. But remember, every journey, no matter how small, is filled with its own adventures and lessons. May your code always compile without errors, and may your functions always return what you expect. Until next time, happy coding, brave coder 🚀👩‍
