# Student Management System and Other Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of C and C++ programs developed for educational purposes, covering a wide range of topics from basic programming concepts to more complex applications like a student management system. The programs are designed to demonstrate various programming techniques, algorithms, and data structures. Below is a brief overview of the included programs and their functionalities.

## Student Management System

The Student Management System (`./PROJECTS/Student.Record.System.v1_dev/record.c`) is a comprehensive program designed to manage the records of students in an institute. It allows for adding, modifying, displaying, and deleting student records, including details like name, department, roll number, and CGPA. It also features a password-protected login system for security.

### Features

-   Add new student records
-   Modify existing records
-   Display all student records
-   Individual student view
-   Remove student records
-   Change password
-   Logout functionality

### Usage

To run the Student Management System, navigate to the directory containing `record.c` and compile it using a C compiler. Execute the compiled program and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Basic Programs

The basic programs (`./BEGINNER/*.c`) cover fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and file operations. They include:

-   Sum of natural numbers
-   Area and perimeter calculations for various shapes
-   Simple and compound interest calculations
-   Distance between two coordinate points
-   And more...

## Geometry Calculations

Several programs calculate areas and volumes of geometric shapes, including spheres, cylinders, cones, and prisms (`./BEGINNER/*.c`). These programs prompt the user for necessary dimensions and output the calculated area and volume.

## Mathematical Operations

These programs perform various mathematical operations, such as sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers, factorial calculations, and more (`./BEGINNER/*.c`).

## Circuit Diagrams

A series of programs demonstrate different types of circuit diagrams using logical operators (`./COLLAGE-PROGRAM/SATYENDRA-SIR/*.c`), illustrating how logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) can be represented in code.

## Miscellaneous Programs

Includes programs for creating shapes with asterisks, swapping numbers, and solving mathematical expressions (`./COLLAGE-PROGRAM/SATYENDRA-SIR/*.c`).

## Running the Programs

To run any of the C programs, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Navigate to the directory containing the program and compile it using:

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
```

Then, execute the compiled program:

```bash
./program_name
```

For C++ programs, use `g++` instead of `gcc` for compilation.
